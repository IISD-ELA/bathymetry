# IISD-ELA Bathymetry Data Processing Repository
Materials for a bathymetry processing method that takes in raw coordinate data and puts out useful data products (geospatial lake polygon, contour lines, and DEM; tabular data; map PDFs). Requires ArcGIS Pro or related software.
* The _python script_ and _how-to doc_ should be used side-by-side to undertake raw data processing. They also explain setup and context.
* The _template tables_ folder holds csv files required for the tabular data production part of the script.
* The _example data_ folder holds a csv file of raw bathymetry transect coordinates that can be used to test the process.
